# Team Up activity for Moodle is a development based on the Teambuilder activity for Moodle ( Thank you Adam Olley)

#This readme files is based on the one of TEAMBUILDER module The Team Up module was developed by the Universty Catholic of Louvain.

Developed by UCLouvain, this is an advanced tool for building teams(group) based on a set of criteria. 
You ask your students some questions, and then develop a predicate based off their answers for your teams. 
This is great if you want a little more control than "Assign Randomly" but less work than "Manual Allocation".
The tool was tested at max with 600 students and more than 100 groups.

It's also a great drag-and-drop interface for building Groups create by Adam Olley; 
if you just want to make your groups yourself but hate the time-consuming Moodle method, then you can use Team Up 
to make your life a bit easier.

The algorithm to create the groups is inspired by GROUPENG 
(https://www.groupeng.org/) that's the main difference with TEAMBUILDER 
that do it by binaries operation GroupEng was written by Thomas Dimiduk while a grad student at Harvard (PhD 2016) 
with Kathryn Dimiduk of Cornell Engineering's 
James McCormick Family Teaching Excellence Institute.
