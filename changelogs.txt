This is a review of modification and change do to Team Builder module to make it 
became Team Up

Files

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\amd\src\build.js
This is where they've the biggest difference from Team Builder and Team Up
Team builder make group based on binaries operation and Team Up from 4 complex 
operations
They've near 900 lines of javascript in Team Builder and more than 2000 
in Team Up.
the two modules look like the same but the heart is very different.
In team up it's an iterative and human like way to group separate or order the 
studend based on their answers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\classes\event\course_module_instance_list_viewed.php
Same file (except change of teambuilder by teamup)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\classes\event\course_module_viewed.php
Same file (except change of teambuilder by teamup)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\classes\output\renderer.php
add of a new that for the help 
new tabobject("help", $helpurl
              ,"<img alt='Help' title='Help' src='/mod/teamup/css/help.png'/>")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\teamup\db\access.php
Same file (except change of teambuilder by teamup)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\db\install.xml
Same file (except change of teambuilder by teamup)
except for the enumvalues of "type" field
'two', 'three', 'four', 'five' was added
it the number of answers by question that must be mandatory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\teamup\db\log.php
Same file (except change of teambuilder by teamup)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\db\upgrade.php
 if ($oldversion < 2011051702) {
 ...
 }
 was removed because already include in the instal.xml
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 \teamup\ajax.php
 Same file (except change of teambuilder by teamup)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\teamup\build.php
That was the second file where a lot of thinks was changed

The sub criterion was removed 

The and & or operations was replaced by 

Group similar individuals	= Form groups whose members are similar to defined 
criteria. Creation of homogeneous groups. Applied to discrete values, with no 
obligation whatsoever numerical.

Disperse similar individuals	= Distribute qualifying students across groups. 
Applied to discrete values, with no obligation whatsoever numerical.

Avoid minorities	= Divide students so that at least two students sharing a 
criterion are in the same group (especially for minorities). 
Applied to discrete values, with no obligation whatsoever numerical.

Balancing Level	= Create groups that are \"right\", whose total forces are 
similar in all groups (usually based on academic results). Applied to numerical 
values ​​(continuous and discrete).

These rules to create group was definied in the GROUPENG python project. And 
apply to teambuilder to become Team Up.

A filter to remove students with no answers was also add.
Actions like optimize (launch again the algorithm)
Or Equalize that try to make team with the same size.

A report was also add with the result and the possibility to see quickly groups 
that not feet to all criterion.

( ***from the doc***
    The number of teams fixes the number of students in each group. For example, 
    123 students in 31 groupes makes 4 individuals in groups.
    Preview : This button launches the group creation with the selected 
    criterias.
    Reset : This button empties all groups and sets students in the part non 
    affected to groups.
    Optimize : This button makes some switches in students distribution to 
    improve the criterias. Succes is not guaranteed but you may repeat 
    optimization several times.
    Equalize : Force to equalize the number of student in each groups. 
    Sometimes necessary after optimization.
)

The last but  not the least it's respect the design and the architecture 
put in place by Adam Olley (UNSW) without that I'll have no idea where to start!
So it's very different and similar !
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\index.php
 Same file (except change of teambuilder by teamup)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\lib.php
add of 
function teamup_get_questions($id, $userid = null) 
and 
function teamup_cm_info_view(cm_info $cm)
So the lib of teambuilder was respected except that teambuilder was replace 
by teamup and these two small functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\mod_form.php
Small modification done when the activities is created
by default we change the start date  and the end date

$mform->addElement('date_time_selector', 'open', 'Open Date'
  ,array('startyear' => 2018,'stopyear'  => 2050,'timezone'=> 99,'step'=> 5));
$defaulttime = strtotime('12:00:00');
$defaulttime = strtotime('+2 days', $defaulttime);
$mform->setDefault('open',  $defaulttime);
$mform->addElement('static', 'openInfo', '', 
  'You will not be able to modify your questionnaire after this date.');
$mform->addElement('date_time_selector', 'close', '
Close Date',array('startyear' => 2018,'stopyear'  => 2050,'timezone'=> 99,'step'=> 5));
$defaulttime = strtotime('12:00:00');
$defaulttime = strtotime('+9 days', $defaulttime);
$mform->setDefault('close',  $defaulttime);
$mform->addElement('checkbox', 'allowupdate', 'Allow updating of answers');
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
styles.css
new styles added after line 288
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version.php
...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\view.php
the main difference is the management of the new types (two, three, four, five)
and also the type in multi-language
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remarks & todo
--------------
The module is in english as the original but was also translated in french.
But not all the english inside the code was transfered in the lang directories.
